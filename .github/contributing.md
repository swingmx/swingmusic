# Swing Music Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to Swing Music. This project uses Python, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/), Sqlite, [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

If you are interested in making a code contribution take a moment to read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `master`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR.

## Development Setup

This project is broken down into 2 parts. The server (this repo) and the client (which lives [here](https://github.com/swing-opensource/swingmusic-client)).

To contribute to the server development, you need to install [Poetry package manager](https://python-poetry.org/docs).

Fork this repo, git clone and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swing-opensource/swingmusic.git

# or with ssh

git clone git@github.com:swing-opensource/swingmusic.git

cd swingmusic

poetry install --with dev # `--with dev` installs all the development dependencies
```

Finally, run the server. You can use a different port if you have another Swing Music instance running on port `1970`.

```sh
poetry run python main.py --port 1980
```

After that, checkout into a new branch and make your changes.

```sh
git checkout <branch_name>
```

Finally, commit your changes and open a pull request.

## Contributing to the client

You need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed in your machine. See their [install guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Fork the repo, git clone and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swing-opensource/swingmusic-client.git

# or with ssh

git clone git@github.com:swing-opensource/swingmusic-client.git

cd swingmusic-client

yarn install
```

You can now run the client.

```sh
yarn dev
```

You can see the client at http://localhost:5173.

> The client is hardcoded to hook into the server on port `1980` (to allow the another server instance to be running on the default port).
> 
> You can follow the instructions above to set up the server in that port, or you can change the port in `swingmusic-client/config.ts`. Don't forget to change it back when in the PR.

## Where can I go for help?
